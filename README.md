# Building-Blocks

Building Blocks is a collection of reusable code snippets and components designed to facilitate the implementation of the beckn protocol. If you are working on a project integrated with beckn protocol you can use the reusuable blocks of code into your project ranging from  frontend to backend for beckn-enabled application, these building blocks can save you time and effort, enabling you to quickly integrate beckn features into your project.

## Features 

- <b>Frontend Components</b>: Reusable UI components for building beckn-compliant user interfaces. Can make desired changes according to your need into the components and all the frontend components could be find in frontend directory. 

- <b>Backend Modules</b>: Helper functions and middleware backend codes to streamline beckn protocol integration. You can make the changes according to the server and other functions and all the modules could be find in the backend directory.
